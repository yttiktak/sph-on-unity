Getting Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics running on computeShaders in Unity3d

Started with interesting mistake, resulting in a power law instead of inverse square gravity.

Added gravity, eg inverse square. Naive, no accounting for discreet steps. Boring, too.

Adding SPH.

Runs on Unity2018 on Ubuntu (Bionic) and on Unity2018 Windows
Trying various sorting ideas.
