# sph-on-unity
Getting Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics running on computeShaders in Unity3d

Started with interesting mistake, resulting in a power law instead of inverse square gravity.

Added gravity, eg inverse square. Naive, no accounting for discreet steps. Boring, too.

Adding SPH. Need to parameterize and get working values for constants.

Runs on Unity2018 on Ubuntu (Bionic). 

Fails on Unity2018 Windows. Tracking that down now.
